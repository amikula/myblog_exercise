== App from Intro to Rails

This is the MyBlog exercise from Alf Mikula's Intro to Rails class.

To get it running you'll need to install Rails 2.3.5 and sqlite3-ruby
gems:

  gem install rails -v 2.3.5
  gem install sqlite3-ruby -v '~> 1.2.5'
  script/server

== Slides

Slides are in doc/slides.s9, and require the "slideshow" gem to build:

  gem install slideshow
  rake slides
  open doc/slides/slides.html
